An online, collaborative whiteboard space for generating ideas.

## How to use

- Simply navigate to https://makers-whiteboard.herokuapp.com/welcome, sign up and draw! 
- Don't draw alone - share board URLs with your friends and draw together!

**Menu**
- Sign up
- Log in
- Search for new boards
- Save your favourite boards 

**Palette**
- Change your pen colour with the colour palette
- Change your pen size with the slider
- Clear the entire board with 'Clear'
- Undo your most recent brush stroke with 'Undo'
- Add Post-its with the yellow Post-it icon. These can be dragged around the page and edited at will.
- If you leave the page, don't worry - your Post-its and drawings with remain! (As long as no one clears the board!)
- If either the palette or the menu are in the way of your drawing, simply move them out of the way! Try it out with the Onbord logo, too...
